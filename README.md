Hello, I'm the Black Panther and the King of Wakanda!

Wakanda Forever!

The Black Panther has been the protector of Wakanda for generations, its mantle being passed from one hero to another. 
We are also home to the heart-shaped herb, our source of strength, and a closely guarded secret. It is what gives superhuman strength to me. Only the worthy are allowed to consume it, which is tried out through battle.

My name is T'Challa and as you know, I'm the King of Wakanda. I have joined the Avengers a few weeks ago and recently, revealed our land to the rest of the world. They think we are a nation of farmers. LOL. Little do they know that we are the technologically most advanced nation in the world.
